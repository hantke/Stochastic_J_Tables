For C users, use the:

_RandomAngle(double Jx0,double Jy0,double Jz0,double angle,double random)
of Core.c
input:
Jx0,Jy0,Jz0 the x,y,z vector of the angular momentum vector.
angle: the angle of difference between the old and the new vector
random: a random value between 0_2pi, that fix the orientation of the change of angle.

Return a 3d array with new values of the vector J

For python users. Please run: python setup.py build
and copy build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/RandomAngle.so in your main folder. This create a function in
python that imported as: 
"from RandomAngle import RandomAngle"
in yout code, and work as the C module explain above.
(you may need to install python-dev)
